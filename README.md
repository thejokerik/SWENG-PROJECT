# Web Development Project 6 - *Data Dashboard Part 2*

Submitted by: **Rudrajit Sengupta (Z23751380)**

This web app: **It's time to continue telling a story with Data Dashboard Part 2! In Part 1, the dashboard view of a dataset of my choosing (SuperHero Database) was created. This week, data visualizations to the dashboard view have been added, and the construction of a detail view containing more info related to a given data point has been made. You will implement dynamic links using React Router, giving each data point listed on your dashboard a unique link to a corresponding detail view.**

Time spent: **7** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

***NOTE:** Superhero API is used for this project: https://superheroapi.com*

- [X] Clicking on an item in the list view displays more details about it
  - Clicking on an item in the dashboard list navigates to a detail view for that item
  - Detail view includes extra information about the item not included in the dashboard view
  - The same navbar is displayed in detail view as in dashboard view
- [X] Each detail view of an item has a direct, unique URL link to that itemâ€™s detail view page
- [X] The app includes at least two unique charts developed using the fetched data that tell an interesting story
  - At least two charts should be incorporated into the dashboard view of the site
  - Each chart should describe a different aspect of the dataset

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [X] The siteâ€™s customized dashboard contains more content that explains what is interesting about the data
  - suggestion for which filters to use
  - an additional page that explains more about the data
- [X] The site allows users to toggle between different data visualizations
  - User should be able to use some mechanism to toggle between displaying and hiding visualizations

## ðŸŽ¯Goals
By the end of this lab, I am able to:

- [X] Use React Router to build navigation around the application
- [X] Use Link to dynamically generate a list of routes
- [X] Use useParams() hook to extract parameters from a URL
- [X] Install and integrate an npm library into an existing React app
